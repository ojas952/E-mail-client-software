# E-mail-client-software

An e-Mail client is a software designed to collect and send electronic mail. It is also referred to as an email program, or mail user agent (MUA) . The term “mail user agent” is less familiar to the average person, but is used in email headers. The headers of the email supply information to the mail servers or computers that handle transferring messages across networks like the Internet. 


Email sent from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) is handled by that ISPs mail server, which is the equivalent of an electronic post office. The mail comes first to the mail server, is processed, and forwarded towards the destination. Anther mail server resides at the destination. It receives all incoming mail and electronically sorts it into mailboxes. The recipient picks up email by using his or her email program to connect to the mail server which request items from the mailbox.


This project develops a similar e-mail client application using Java and some Java APIs. We use standard sockets and networking and with them additional Java Mail API. The protocols used here are SMTP, POP3. The POP3 is  used to receive the mails which has been send to our address.
